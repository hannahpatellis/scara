Sapphic Citadel Automated Residency Application (ScARA) Project

Any known bugs or planned features will be listed here by date of entry.

*~~*

Add better error handling to server.js: Currently dies if a weird request comes from WU
Add better error handling in all the json.load functions in home.py: Currently they get caught up on json.load if the string isn't perfectly prepped

The way functions are triggered when a websocket connection is made on the server. Currently makes multiple intervals and doesn't seem efficient.

Add Wink/Sensi integration
Add Amazon Alexa integration
Add webcam integration
