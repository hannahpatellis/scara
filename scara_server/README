Sapphic Citadel Automated Residency Application (ScARA) Project

*~~*

ScARA is in early early development and does not work 100% yet

*~~*

ScARA Server is written primarily in Node.js and handles the communications between external smart home devices and the ScARA Panels. It keeps all the Panels up to date using websockets.

	Panel <--->
	Panel <---> Server <--> Smart devices
	Panel <--->

Recommended equipment for server:
	•	Raspberry Pi, any model
	•	A USB wi-fi adapter if it's not a Raspberry Pi 3, or unless you're going to use ethernet
	•	16GB microSD card
	•	Power cord/supply for the Pi

Install and setup:
	•	Copy the included image file onto a microSD card
	•	Boot
	•	Connect to you network
	•	Assign static IP address via your router
	•	Change hostname
	⁃		sudo nano /etc/hosts
	⁃		sudo nano /etc/hostname
	•	Change password
	⁃		passwd
	•	Make UI configurations
	⁃	Remove task bar icons that aren't needed
	⁃		Set the task bar to under windows
	⁃		Set wallpaper (if so desired)
	⁃		Remove trash can icon
	•	Install required packages
	⁃		curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_7.x | sudo -E bash -
	⁃		sudo apt-get install -y nodejs
	⁃		sudo apt-get install -y build-essential
	•	SFTP to your Pi and upload the scara_server folder to the home directory (so that you have /home/pi/scara_server)
	•	Place ScARA Panel.desktop in the correct places for Application menu
	⁃		sudo cp "/home/pi/scara_server/ScARA Server.desktop" "/usr/share/applications/ScARA Server.desktop"
	•	Open the scara_server directory and install Node.js packages
	⁃		cd /home/pi/scara_server
	⁃		npm install websocket
	⁃		npm install request
	•	Place an icon to ScARA Server in the task bar
	•	Run ScARA Server and enjoy

Notes:
	•	The server is made to run headless, no need to keep it hooked up to a display. However, the image provided includes drivers for the TFT touch screen used on the ScARA Panels, so it's there just in case
	•	Make sure to give the server a static IP address through your router
