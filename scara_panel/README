Sapphic Citadel Automated Residency Application (ScARA) Project

*~~*

ScARA is in early early development and does not work 100% yet

*~~*

ScARA Panel is written primarily in Python 3.5 and PyQt5 (Qt framework). The job of the panel is to be mounted on the wall and offer a friendly, modern, easy interface to alter smart devices in the house.

Recommended equipment for each panel:
	•	Raspberry Pi Model 3
	•	16GB microSD card
	•	3.5" LCD TFT touch screen display for Raspberry Pi + acrylic case (https://www.aliexpress.com/item/2015-New-Original-3-5-LCD-TFT-Touch-Screen-Display-for-Raspberry-Pi-2-Model-B/32443391725.html)
	•	Power cord/supply for the Pi

Install and setup:
	•	Copy the included image file onto a microSD card
	•	Boot
	•	Connect to you network
	•	Assign static IP address via your router
	•	Change hostname
	⁃		sudo nano /etc/hosts
	⁃		sudo nano /etc/hostname
	•	Change password
	⁃		passwd
	•	Make UI configurations
	⁃		Remove task bar icons that aren't needed
	⁃		Set the task bar to under windows
	⁃		Set wallpaper (if so desired)
	⁃		Remove trash can icon
	•	Install required packages
	⁃		sudo apt-get install python3 python3-pyqt5
	⁃		sudo pip3 install websocket-client
	•	SFTP to your Pi and upload the scara_panel folder to the home directory (so that you have /home/pi/scara_panel)
	•	Place ScARA Panel.desktop in the correct places for Application menu
	⁃		sudo cp "/home/pi/scara_panel/ScARA Panel.desktop" "/usr/share/applications/ScARA Panel.desktop"
	•	Place an icon to ScARA Panel in the task bar
	•	Copy fonts into ~/Fonts
	•	Copy fonts to correct directory
	⁃		sudo cp ~/Fonts/* /usr/local/share/fonts
	•	Rebuild font cache
	⁃		fc-cache -fv
	•	Run ScARA Panel and enjoy

Notes:
	•	You will probably want to assign static IPs for each panel in addition to the server through your router
	•	Do not do a system-wide apt-get upgrade because it will break the driver for the LCD display
